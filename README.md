## Gator Raider

The only custom file in this Project is `StudentAttackerController.java`

This file can be found in the `src/edu/ufl/cise/cs1/controllers` folder.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI controller for a Pac-Man like Attacker (Go Gators!)

My initial commit was hacked together like a duct-taped abomination, found in `StudentAttackerControllerBACKUP.java`

The current generation achieves a 6272/6400, or 98% of the grading success rate, but I hope to tweak the controller logic to get above 10,000.

## Gator Raider

Part of the UF COP3502 course, the goal of this project is to develop an AI controller for a Pac-Man like Attacker (Go Gators!)

The only custom file in this Project is `StudentAttackerController.java`

This file can be found in the `src/edu/ufl/cise/cs1/controllers` folder.

The current generation achieves a 6272/6400, or 98% of the grading success rate, but I hope to tweak the controller logic to get above 10,000.
